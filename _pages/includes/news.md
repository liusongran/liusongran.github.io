- *2025.09*: **I am actively looking for motivated undergraduate/master students.** 
- *2025.09*: [Project] Seeking motivated undergraduate students for the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Program (China). Join our teams working on **BetterMinton** or **ElectroDaemon**. **BetterMinton** is an undergraduate innovation project that integrates motion sensors with 3D visualization to help badminton beginners correct their strokes and posture. By comparing users‚Äô movements with expert trajectories, the system provides real-time interactive feedback and personalized training guidance. **ElectroDaemon** is a non-intrusive anomaly detection tool that continuously monitors microcontroller electromagnetic (EM) emissions to identify deviations from established execution flow patterns. By comparing real-time EM signal features against a learned ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fingerprint, it can promptly flag and alert on atypical behavior such as control-flow anomalies or unauthorized modifications.
