Welcome to my homepage! I am currently working at [Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing in Medical Image]() as a Tenure Track Assistant Professor in Northeastern University, China. I created this website to share the output of my studies and be reachable.

I graduated from [College of Information Science and Engineering](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/YW/main.htm), Northeastern University with a bachelor's and master's degree and from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/), Northeastern University with a doctor's degree, advised by Professor [Wang Yi (çŽ‹ä¹‰)]() and [Nan Guan (å…³æ¥ )](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/nanguan.htm). Between 2020 and 2021, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/).

My primary research interests lie within embedded systems, recently pivoting towards Autonomous Driving and Real-Time Robotic Operating Systems (ROS), as well as Batteryless Energy-Harvesting Systems. In collaboration with my research partners, we delve into operating systems and runtimes, intermittent computing, and trustworthy, real-time edge AI, with a specialized focus on autonomous driving.
