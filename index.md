# About Me
I am an assistant professor at Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing in Medical Image, Northeastern University. My research interests are in the area of embedded systems, with a recent focus on intermittent systems and robot operating system. Overall, I aim at designing real systems that are provably dependable, highly adaptive, and sustainable by design.

You can find more info about [me]() here. Source codes I have developed in the past are [here]().

# Research Interests
Intermittent Systems, Real-time Embedded Systems, Robot Operating System, On-Device AI
